            <h1>7 Reasons Why Your Business Needs a Website</h1>
            <p>Over 60% of small businesses have a website that drives targeted, direct leads to their company. There’s
                a lot that goes into a website’s success, but every business needs to start with one. As a digital web
                agency, we explain to our clients that there are a lot of reasons to build a website.</p>
            <h2>1. Customers Expect You to Have a Web Presence</h2>
            <p>Local consumers use search engines to find information about businesses in their area. According to Think
                with Google, 80% of consumers, use search engines to learn about local businesses.</p>
            <p>If you don’t have a website, you’re pushing potential consumers away and boosting the sales of your
                competitors.</p>
            <p>With your target audience on their smartphones searching for goods and services before picking up a phone
                or going to your store, it’s essential to have a website. The cost to hire a web design firm and getting
                your website running is more affordable than most businesses think.</p>
            <p>In today’s fast-paced world, you can’t afford not to have a website.</p>
            <a href="https://liquidweb.i3f2.net/c/2671719/297279/4464" target="_top" id="297279"><img
                    src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4464-297279" border="0" alt="Liquid Web Managed Word Press"
                    width="100%" /></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://liquidweb.i3f2.net/i/2671719/297279/4464"
                style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
            <h2>2. Websites Provide Social Proof</h2>
            <p>Reviews and social proof can nurture leads and build brand trust. When you have rave reviews, consumers
                will seek out your website to find more information about your brand. If you don’t have a website,
                you’re at risk of losing customers.</p>
            <p>Websites should provide the additional social proof your business needs to gain the trust of consumers
                through:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Customer testimonials</li>
                <li>Reviews from customers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your site is a way to impress and nurture potential buyers.</p>
            <h2>3. Your Business Needs to be Discoverable</h2>
            <p>Websites make your business discoverable. Consumers and clients begin their searches for local products
                and services online. In fact, over 45% of all searches are local. A quick “Google search” can lead
                consumers to your brand’s website. If the search doesn’t lead to your website, consumers will go to your
                competitors instead.</p>
            <p>If you have a website, you can work with a design marketing agency that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increases your search engine rankings</li>
                <li>Optimizes your site for local searches</li>
                <li>Ensures your business and site are listed on all important directories</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A website is the new business card, connecting potential customers to your business 24 hours a day, seven
                days a week.</p>
            <h2>4. Websites Build Credibility</h2>
            <p>Customers don’t want to take risks. Reviews and testimonials are sought after because the consumer wants
                to make a smart purchasing decision. Credibility is what drives sales, and even if you have great
                reviews and testimonials, your website will have a major impact on your sales.</p>
            <p>Websites that are poorly designed lose traffic.</p>
            <p>Mobile visitors are extremely conscious of their purchases, and over 55% of mobile visitors won’t
                recommend your site if their mobile experience was poor.</p>
            <p>Websites can make a good first impression, or they can make a bad impression. The right responsive web
                design company can revamp an old site or develop a new site that’s:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mobile-friendly</li>
                <li>Easy to use</li>
                <li>Converts visitors into sales</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A responsive, well-built website can build your credibility and lead to an increase in sales.</p>
            <h2>5. Cost Effective Marketing</h2>
            <p>If you want to market to consumers online, you need a website for the visitor to land on. You can use
                your website to expand your marketing online in a cost-effective way. When you have a website, you can
                create a marketing strategy that includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Social media marketing</li>
                <li>Search engine optimization</li>
                <li>Pay-per-click advertising</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can use your website as a way for consumers to connect with your business through cost-effective
                marketing.</p>
            <h2>6. Websites Never Close</h2>
            <p>Most businesses don’t have a 24/7 hotline where customers can call and ask questions. Websites, on the
                other hand, never close. You can build a website that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Educates potential customers and clients</li>
                <li>Nurtures leads to gain trust</li>
                <li>Sells products or services directly</li>
                <li>Provides answers to questions potential buyers have</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If your website is designed and planned properly, it can work for your business night and day to gain the
                trust of customers and generate sales.</p>

                height="0" width="0" src="https://liquidweb.i3f2.net/i/2671719/386656/4464"
                style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
            <h2>7. Grow Your Business</h2>

                work alongside digital creative agencies to build a site that increases sales and builds your brand.</p>

            <ul>
